# Cross-Validation-and-GridSearchCV
This notebook demonstrates the practical implementation of model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning techniques in machine learning using Cross-Validation and GridSearchCV. It applies these techniques on a classification task using scikit-learn, enabling robust model selection and performance optimization.
